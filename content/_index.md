<!-- I am an applied scientist at Amazon Alexa AI in New York City. I have a background in math and used to do research on theoretical aspects of computer vision and machine learning. You can find a list of my academic papers on google scholar and read more about my scientific interests on the [[math]] section of this site.

I grew up between Pisa (Italy) and Yorktown Heights (NY), but I also lived for several years in Paris. A long time ago, I was a fencer in the Italian national team.  -->
