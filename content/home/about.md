# About

<br>

I am a post-doc researcher at the [Courant Institute of
Mathematical Sciences](https://cims.nyu.edu/) at [NYU](https://www.nyu.edu/). I received my PhD at [École Normale
Supérieure](http://www.ens.fr/?lang=fr), under the supervision [Jean
Ponce](http://www.di.ens.fr/~ponce/) and [Martial
Hebert](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/person.html?person_id=109). I have a "Master 2" 
Degree in Mathematics, Machine Learning and Computer Vision
([MVA](http://www.math.ens-cachan.fr/version-francaise/formations/master-mva/))
from [École Normale Supérieure de
Cachan](http://www.ens-cachan.fr/version-anglaise/). I also have a
Master's degree in Mathematics from the [University of
Pisa](https://www.dm.unipi.it/index.html/), enrolled as a student of [Scuola
Normale Superiore](http://en.sns.it/). My full CV is {{% staticref

My PhD thesis was on mathematics and 3D vision. I am now looking into geometric properties of neural networks.
