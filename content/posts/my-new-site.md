This used to be my academic website but it is now my personal website. You can find a list of my academic papers on google scholar.

I am Italian-American, but grew up mostly in Pisa, Italy. 

I live in New York City, where I work as an applied scientist at Amazon Alexa AI.

I'm interested in (and sometimes write about) math, philosophy, art.
