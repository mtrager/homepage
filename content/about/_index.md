I have a background in math and have worked on theoretical aspects of computer vision and machine learning. You can find a list of my academic papers on [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=g3sXAWkAAAAJ&hl=en) and read more about my scientific interests [here]({{< ref "math.md" >}}).


I grew up between Pisa (Italy) and Yorktown Heights (NY, USA), and I lived for several years in Paris. I also used to be a fencer in the Italian national team.
