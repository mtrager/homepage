abstract = "We introduce a theory of multigraded Cayley-Chow forms associated to subvarieties of products of projective spaces. Two new phenomena arise: first, the construction turns out to require certain inequalities on the dimensions of projections; and second, in positive characteristic the multigraded Cayley-Chow forms can have higher multiplicities. The theory also provides a natural framework for understanding multifocal tensors in computer vision."
